%% Abstract
\begin{abstract}

    This document represents my notes on automata theory.
    Hence, it is of an academic nature. \\ 
    Secondly, this document serves as a refresher on LaTeX. 
    It has been about 4-5 years since I touched LaTeX last,
    so it is worthwhile to get up to speed on it.
